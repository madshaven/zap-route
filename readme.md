The idea was to create a sort of pager, and developed into more of a way of setting a route.

This project started with me trying to better understand how Streamlit works.

I created something quite complicated to go from page to page.
Then I cleaned it all.
Then I further improved it by taking some more cues from Streamlit-Extra-Components.
